1. Do not push directly to master
2. Create a separate branch for yourself and create a pull request
3. All changes should be commented appropriately
4. Before working on a new task
  1. Create a new local branch: *git checkout -b branch_name*
  2. Pull from the master branch of the origin source: *git pull origin master*
5. Do not use point-and-click interfaces, use command prompt for all GIT activities
